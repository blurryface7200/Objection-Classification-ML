# Objection-Classification-ML
 ML model for classifying CIFAR-10 images (one test batch).

The dataset used is CIFAR-10 which has 10 different categories of images with each category containing 1000 sample images. Â It has 10 different classes of images i.e., airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship and truck.

The methodology used in the model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It is achieved by training a model using the training images and labels and tweaking and adding on a few layers to achieve better accuracy. 

Achieved an accuracy of 53.1% on the testing data.
